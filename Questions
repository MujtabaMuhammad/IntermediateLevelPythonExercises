5. **APIs and Web Scraping:**
   - Use the `requests` library to fetch data from a public API and display it in a readable format.
   - Write a web scraper to extract data from a website and save it to a CSV file.

6. **Data Analysis:**
   - Load a CSV file using pandas and perform basic data analysis (mean, median, mode).
   - Write a program to plot data from a CSV file using matplotlib.

7. **Error Handling:**
   - Write a program that handles different types of exceptions (e.g., FileNotFoundError, ValueError).
   - Create a custom exception class and use it in a simple program.

8. **Regular Expressions:**
   - Write a program to validate an email address using regular expressions.
   - Create a program that extracts phone numbers from a text using regular expressions.

9. **Databases:**
   - Connect to a SQLite database, create a table, insert data, and perform basic queries.
   - Write a program that interacts with a PostgreSQL database to perform CRUD operations.

10. **Networking:**
    - Write a program to implement a simple chat application using sockets.
    - Create a TCP server that listens for incoming connections and echoes received messages back to the client.

11. **Concurrency:**
    - Write a program that demonstrates the use of threading to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
    - Create a program that uses multiprocessing to speed up a CPU-bound task.

12. **File Compression:**
    - Write a program to compress and decompress files using the `gzip` module.
    - Create a program that zips multiple files into a single archive and unzips them back.

13. **Image Processing:**
    - Write a program to load, display, and save images using the `PIL` library.
    - Implement a program to convert an image to grayscale using OpenCV.

14. **Game Development:**
    - Create a simple text-based game (e.g., a guessing game or a quiz game).
    - Develop a basic 2D game using the Pygame library.

15. **Cryptography:**
    - Write a program to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher.
    - Implement a program to generate and verify hash values using the `hashlib` library.

16. **Web Development:**
    - Create a simple web application using Flask that handles user input and displays output.
    - Develop a RESTful API using Flask and SQLAlchemy.

17. **Data Visualization:**
    - Write a program to create a bar chart and a line graph using matplotlib.
    - Use seaborn to create a heatmap from a dataset.

18. **Unit Testing:**
    - Write unit tests for a given module using the `unittest` framework.
    - Create a test suite that includes multiple test cases and assertions.

19. **Functional Programming:**
    - Write a program that uses map, filter, and reduce functions.
    - Implement a decorator to measure the execution time of a function.

20. **GUI Development:**
    - Create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.
    - Develop a more complex GUI application (e.g., a calculator or a text editor) using Tkinter.

These exercises cover a range of topics and should provide a solid foundation for intermediate Python programming skills.
